<p><a href="https://quirky-galileo-15c479.netlify.com/" title="title">Shopping</a></p>


Project idea is to learn how to make some features as: local storage, drag and drop, routing and some others you can see below:

### Tasks:
* User sees a list of products on the left side;
* User sees the list of products he has chosen on the right side;
* Every product has the fields name quantity price and sum;
* Clicking on an item on the left should add it to the cart
* At the bottom of the cart users see the total component which shows the total price x quantity of items selected.
* A few of the products have a discount - "Pay for 2, get 3rd one for free". 
* On page reload the cart is not lost - you may use `localStorage`.
* Items appear/disappear from the cart with an animation.
* Users can use Drag & Drop
* There is a searchbar 
* User can toggle light/dark? theme of the app.
* React-router or  is used to lead to the checkout page, where user goes through a stepper to enter his address and credit card details in a multi step process.
* Some items have limited quantity, and as user tries to increase the quantity on the cart, a snackbar appears with a warning notification that the stock is limited.
* Items in the shop that have a quantity 0, can't even be added to the cart (are disabled)
